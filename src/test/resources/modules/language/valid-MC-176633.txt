Lime carpets are named "acacia slab" in Spanish (Spain)

h3. The bug
Lime carpets are named "Losa de acacia" ("acacia slab") in Spanish (Spain), despite the translation on Crowdin being "Alfombra verde lima" ("Lime carpet") since 6 years.

h3. To reproduce
# Check that the translation on Crowdin is correct: https://crowdin.com/translate/minecraft/9412/enus-es#5194750
# Get a lime carpet
# Change language to {{Español (España)}}
# Look at the name of the carpet
