Hebrew letters aren't assigned to their correct textures

h3. The bug
With 1.14 Hebrew letters have been added to the Minecraft font. However, most (if not all) letters seem to have been assigned to the incorrect texture. For instance, the letter א (Alef) is assigned to the texture that belogs to the letter ח (Het).

h3. To reproduce
# Paste {noformat}מיינקראפט{noformat} into the chat ("Minecraft" in Hebrew according to the Hebrew wikipedia)
# Compare what's been written into the game to what you just copied from here
# (x) The letters don't match

h3. Fix
Download the attached resource pack, put it into your resource packs folder, and enable it. That should fix this issue.

h3. Workaround
You can work around this issue by enabling the Unicode font by clicking on the left button at the bottom of the language menu.

h3. Original description
Every time you type in Hebrew it switches the keys that you wrote. For example:

That's that would happen in English: If you type the letter Y it would write O instead.
